## Next steps

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Start from a good foundation" icon="pencil">
    Hate being asked to write up a job description every time a new position
    opens? Or how about trying to find those interview questions you wrote last
    year? Use these interview questions as a mostly complete foundation and make
    a few small tweaks to make them your own!
  </Card>
  <Card title="Completely open source" icon="add-document">
    Anyone is allowed to post interview questions on this site by using the main
    project repository hosted on
    [GitHub](https://github.com/eajr/jobinterviews-fyi). Fork the project, add
    your job title and interview questions, and submit a Pull Request. It won't
    take long till your change is merged and available for the world!
  </Card>
  <Card title="License & attribution free" icon="setting">
    All job descriptions & interview questions are under [MIT
    License](https://opensource.org/license/mit). Use it without any changes, or
    make as many changes as you want. Even this Astro app is open source and
    under the same license so feel free to fork and host your own version!
  </Card>
  <Card title="Looking for job descriptions?" icon="open-book">
    Our sister site [JobDescriptions.fyi](https://jobdescriptions.fyi) is a
    collection of job descriptions for a wide range of positions. Let us be your
    one stop shop for all things jobs-related.
